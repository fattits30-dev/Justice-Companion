### Timeline

**October 6, 2025**: Beta testing began with 4-agent parallel execution
- File monitoring agent
- Fix suggester agent
- Intelligent fixer agent
- Test runner agent

**October 7, 2025**: Continued testing and refinement
- Final artifacts generated at 18:01:24 UTC

**October 8, 2025**: Artifacts archived
- Active files remain in automation/ root directories
- Historical data preserved here

### Reason for Archival

These files were generated as part of automated orchestrator testing but are no longer needed for active development:

1. **Historical Value**: Provides record of beta testing activities
2. **Not Referenced**: No active code or scripts reference these files
3. **Clutter Reduction**: Reduced automation/ directory from 478 files to ~50 active files (90% reduction)
4. **Preservation**: All data preserved (not deleted) for potential future analysis

### Active Files Retained

The following remain in active use in automation/:

- `scripts/*.py` - All 12 orchestrator scripts (ACTIVE)
- `agents/*.py` - All 4 agent modules (ACTIVE)
- `tests/*.py` - All 5 test files (ACTIVE)
- `src/simple-orchestrator.ts` - TypeScript orchestrator (ACTIVE)
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript build output (ACTIVE)
- `state/` - Runtime state files (ACTIVE)
- `results/eslint-cleanup-2025-10-08/` - Recent campaign results (ACTIVE)
- Configuration files: `.env`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `tsconfig.json`
- Launch scripts: `*.bat` files
- Documentation: `README.md` and guides
