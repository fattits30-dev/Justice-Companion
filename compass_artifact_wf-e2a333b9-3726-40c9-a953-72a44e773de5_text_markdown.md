# The definitive guide to Windows native development for large-scale TypeScript/Electron projects

**For a solo developer working on a 50,000-line TypeScript/Electron/React application on Windows native (not WSL), this research provides battle-tested recommendations for terminal setup, CLI tooling, IDE selection, and workflow optimization. Bottom line: Windows Terminal + PowerShell 7 + pnpm + VS Code with Copilot delivers the best balance of performance, cost, and reliability for your stack.**

Windows has matured dramatically for JavaScript development in 2024-2025. With proper configuration, native Windows development now rivals Unix-based systems while maintaining the advantages of Windows-native tooling. This guide covers every critical decision point for your 50k-line TypeScript/Electron/React application with encrypted case management, AI integration, and comprehensive testing.

## Windows Terminal emerges as the clear winner for native development

After evaluating Windows Terminal, Warp, Alacritty, and Hyper against the needs of a TypeScript/Electron developer, **Windows Terminal stands out as the optimal choice**. Microsoft's official terminal emulator received its largest-ever updates in 2024-2025, adding sixels support, fuzzy search, snippet actions, and dramatic windowing improvements. With 45MB memory usage, 13ms median latency, and native PowerShell 7+ integration, it outperforms alternatives in the areas that matter most for development workflows.

Windows Terminal's native split panes (`Alt+Shift+D` for vertical, `Alt+Shift+-` for horizontal) eliminate the need for tmux while maintaining professional-grade stability. The recent buffer restore feature remembers terminal state across restarts—essential when juggling multiple development sessions. Version 1.24 introduced Quake-mode summoning and right-click pane management, making it feel modern without sacrificing performance.

**Warp just launched for Windows in February 2025**, bringing AI-powered command suggestions and collaborative terminal sharing. While innovative, it requires 100-200MB baseline memory (up to 2GB with AI features active) and mandates cloud connectivity for core features. For team environments valuing cutting-edge AI integration, Warp offers unique capabilities. However, its account requirement, higher resource consumption, and relative Windows immaturity make it less suitable for solo developers prioritizing stability and privacy.

**Alacritty remains the performance champion** with 18-30MB memory footprint, 39 MB/s stdout throughput, and 7.25ms dense cell rendering—the fastest in all benchmarks. Written in Rust with GPU acceleration, it delivers unmatched responsiveness on older hardware. The tradeoff: zero native tabs, no built-in scrollback, and minimal UI features by design. If you're comfortable with tmux and want absolute speed, Alacritty excels. For most developers, the feature limitations outweigh the speed gains.

**Avoid Hyper entirely**. Despite its attractive Electron-based interface, Dan Luu's comprehensive testing revealed critical failures: 178MB baseline memory, complete hangs with heavy terminal output, and test failures showing 10+ minute freezes. At 144.84ms for dense cells (20x slower than Alacritty) and 1257ms scrolling performance, Hyper is unusable for professional TypeScript development work.

| Terminal | Memory | Latency | Features | Windows Integration | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Windows Terminal** | 45MB | 13ms | ⭐⭐⭐ Native panes/tabs | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | **Primary choice** |
| **Warp** | 100-200MB | ~35ms | ⭐⭐⭐ AI + collaboration | ⭐⭐ Good, new | Teams, AI-focused |
| **Alacritty** | 18-30MB | 28ms | ⭐ Minimal | ⭐⭐ Good | Speed specialists |
| **Hyper** | 178MB | 32ms | ⭐⭐ Extensible | ⭐⭐ Good | ❌ Avoid |

### Setting up Windows Terminal for TypeScript/Electron development

Install via Windows Store, winget (`winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`), or Chocolatey. Set PowerShell 7+ as default by modifying `settings.json` (Ctrl+Shift+,):

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "{574e775e-4f2a-5b96-ac1e-a2962a402336}",
  "profiles": {
    "defaults": {
      "font": {
        "face": "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font",
        "size": 11
      },
      "colorScheme": "One Half Dark",
      "opacity": 95
    }
  },
  "actions": [
    { "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "vertical" }, "keys": "alt+shift+d" },
    { "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "horizontal" }, "keys": "alt+shift+-" }
  ]
}
```

**Install Cascadia Code Nerd Font** for proper icon display with oh-my-posh and terminal-icons. Download from GitHub releases (microsoft/cascadia-code) or nerdfonts.com. As of version 2404.23, Cascadia Code includes Nerd Font glyphs natively, making it the perfect choice for Windows developers.

Configure a development workspace that auto-launches with split panes for different tasks:

```json
"startupActions": "new-tab -p 'PowerShell' -d 'C:\\dev\\myapp'; split-pane -p 'PowerShell' -d 'C:\\dev\\myapp' --title 'Dev Server'; split-pane -H -p 'PowerShell' -d 'C:\\dev\\myapp' --title 'Tests'"
```

This creates a three-pane layout: one for general commands, one for `npm run dev`, and one for `npm run test:watch`—the ideal setup for active TypeScript/Electron development.

## PowerShell 7+ with optimized modules creates a powerful development shell

PowerShell 7+ offers dramatic improvements over Windows PowerShell 5.1: cross-platform compatibility, improved performance, and modern features like ternary operators and pipeline parallelization. For TypeScript/Node.js development, a properly configured PowerShell profile transforms the command-line experience.

**Oh My Posh replaces posh-git themes** as the modern prompt engine. Written in Go for performance, it supports 100+ themes and displays git status, Node version, execution time, and exit codes. Install via `winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh`, then initialize in your profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\\jandedobbeleer.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```

Popular themes for developers include `jandedobbeleer` (balanced), `night-owl` (dark-optimized), and `powerlevel10k_rainbow` (feature-rich). Each theme is customizable via JSON to show exactly the context you need—particularly useful for displaying Node versions when switching between projects.

**PSReadLine with predictive IntelliSense** (version 2.2.6+) provides history-based command suggestions as you type, dramatically reducing repetitive typing. Enable ListView mode for multi-line suggestions:

```powershell
Install-Module PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force

Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource HistoryAndPlugin
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
```

**Terminal-Icons** adds colorful file type icons to `ls` and `dir` output, making directory navigation more intuitive. Install via `Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Repository PSGallery` and import in your profile. Requires a Nerd Font to display properly.

**Profile optimization is critical** to avoid slow startup times. The recommended modules (Oh My Posh, PSReadLine, Terminal-Icons) typically load in under 500ms when properly configured. Measure your profile with `Measure-Command { . $PROFILE }` and defer non-essential initialization to keep startup snappy. Avoid loading heavy modules like posh-git if not actively using Git in every session—consider conditional loading instead.

### Complete PowerShell profile for TypeScript development

```powershell
# Performance tracking
$ProfileStart = Get-Date

# Prompt and icons
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\\jandedobbeleer.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons

# PSReadLine configuration
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource HistoryAndPlugin
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
Set-PSReadLineOption -EditMode Windows
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete

# Useful aliases
Set-Alias -Name g -Value git
Set-Alias -Name lg -Value lazygit

# Node version manager (fnm) initialization
fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

# Display load time
$ProfileEnd = Get-Date
Write-Host "Profile loaded in $([math]::Round(($ProfileEnd - $ProfileStart).TotalMilliseconds))ms" -ForegroundColor Green
```

This configuration provides git status, Node version display, fast command completion, and auto-switching Node versions with fnm—all loading in under 500ms.

## Volta edges out competitors for automatic Node version management on Windows

Node version managers solve the critical problem of juggling multiple Node.js versions across projects. For Windows developers, the choice between nvm-windows, Volta, and fnm significantly impacts daily workflow efficiency.

**Volta wins for team workflows and automatic switching**. Written in Rust, it delivers 40x faster version switching than nvm-windows while automatically detecting and using the correct Node version based on `package.json` configuration. When you `cd` into a project directory, Volta seamlessly switches versions without manual `nvm use` commands—eliminating a common source of "works on my machine" issues.

Volta manages your entire JavaScript toolchain (Node, npm, yarn) through a single pinning mechanism. Add `"volta": { "node": "20.10.0", "npm": "10.2.3" }` to `package.json`, and every team member automatically uses identical versions. This project-level version locking is superior to `.nvmrc` files that require manual activation.

**fnm (Fast Node Manager) prioritizes raw speed** with 30-50ms version switches and cross-platform compatibility. It works with `.node-version` and `.nvmrc` files for auto-switching, making it compatible with existing projects. fnm's minimalist design appeals to developers who want speed without Volta's opinionated toolchain management.

**nvm-windows remains popular but shows its age**. With 200-500ms version switches and mandatory manual `nvm use` in each terminal session, it creates friction in multi-project workflows. The separate Windows implementation means different behavior than Unix nvm, causing confusion for developers switching between platforms.

| Feature | Volta | fnm | nvm-windows |
|---------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Switch speed** | 40-60ms | 30-50ms | 200-500ms |
| **Auto-switching** | ✅ package.json | ✅ .nvmrc/.node-version | ❌ Manual |
| **Toolchain management** | ✅ Node+npm+yarn | ❌ Node only | ❌ Node only |
| **Windows native** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Low | Low |
| **Recommendation** | **Teams, automation** | Speed-focused | Legacy projects |

Install Volta via `winget install Volta.Volta`, then pin your project versions:

```bash
volta install node@20
volta install npm@10
cd your-project
volta pin node@20 npm@10  # Adds to package.json
```

From this point forward, everyone working on the project automatically uses Node 20 and npm 10 without configuration—a massive workflow improvement for solo developers maintaining multiple projects or eventual team collaboration.

## pnpm delivers the best performance and disk efficiency for Windows development

Package manager choice dramatically affects install speed, disk usage, and dependency reliability. Benchmarks from pnpm.io (updated daily) show consistent performance advantages that compound over time.

**pnpm installs 3x faster than npm** while using 70% less disk space through content-addressable storage and hard links. A typical `npm install` with cache and lockfile takes 8.1 seconds; pnpm completes the same operation in 2.3 seconds. With warm cache, pnpm drops to 730ms versus npm's 1.3 seconds. For a 50,000-line TypeScript project with extensive dependencies, these savings add up to hours saved per week.

The performance advantage stems from pnpm's architecture. Instead of duplicating packages across projects, pnpm maintains a global store and creates hard links in each project's `node_modules`. This approach delivers both speed and disk efficiency without sacrificing compatibility—pnpm works with 99%+ of npm packages.

**Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies**, a common source of production bugs. npm's flat `node_modules` structure allows code to import packages not declared in `package.json`, creating hidden dependencies that break when deployed. pnpm's symlinked structure enforces proper dependency declarations, catching these issues during development rather than production.

**Monorepo support in pnpm is first-class**. If your Electron app grows to include separate packages (main process, renderer, shared libraries, build tools), pnpm workspaces handle the complexity better than npm or yarn. The performance benefits compound in monorepo scenarios where workspace dependencies are frequently updated.

**Yarn remains viable** with better performance than npm and mature workspace support, but pnpm's combination of speed, disk efficiency, and strict dependency resolution makes it the superior choice for 2025. Yarn's PnP (Plug'n'Play) mode offers comparable speed but breaks many packages—the compatibility tradeoffs aren't worth it for most projects.

Install pnpm globally with `npm install -g pnpm`, then use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` in your projects. The CLI is nearly identical to npm, minimizing the learning curve. For global packages, use `pnpm add -g package-name`.

## Essential CLI tools streamline TypeScript/Electron development workflows

Beyond the shell and package manager, several CLI tools transform daily development efficiency for large TypeScript codebases.

**GitHub CLI (`gh`)** integrates GitHub operations directly into your terminal. Create pull requests (`gh pr create`), review issues (`gh issue list`), trigger workflows (`gh workflow run`), and manage repositories without leaving the command line. For projects using GitHub Actions for CI/CD, `gh` eliminates constant browser context switching. Install via `winget install GitHub.cli` and authenticate with `gh auth login`.

**ripgrep (`rg`) outperforms grep and Windows search by 5-10x** for code searching. It respects `.gitignore` automatically, uses parallel searching, and provides clean output. Search all TypeScript files for a pattern: `rg "pattern" --type ts`. Show context lines: `rg -C 3 "pattern"`. Search with file path filters: `rg "import" --glob "*.ts"`. Install via `winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC`.

**fd improves file finding** with intuitive syntax and gitignore awareness. Find all test files: `fd test.ts`. By extension: `fd -e ts`. Execute commands on results: `fd -e js -x eslint`. Install via `winget install sharkdp.fd`.

**fzf (fuzzy finder) enables interactive file and command selection**. Combined with PowerShell integration (`Install-Module PSFzf`), it provides `Ctrl+R` for fuzzy command history search and `Ctrl+F` for file finding. Open files in VS Code: `code $(fd --type f | fzf)`. Switch git branches: `git branch | fzf | xargs git checkout`.

**bat (better cat)** displays files with syntax highlighting and git integration. Use `bat file.ts` instead of `cat` or `type` for readable code viewing in the terminal. Install via `winget install sharkdp.bat`.

**jq processes JSON** from APIs and config files. Parse npm package.json: `jq '.dependencies' package.json`. Filter API responses: `curl api.com | jq '.data.items'`. Install via `winget install jqlang.jq`.

**lazygit provides a terminal UI for git** that's faster than switching to a GUI application. Run `lazygit` in any repository for visual staging, committing, branching, and rebasing. Install via `winget install JesseDuffield.lazygit`.

**SQLite CLI** is essential for inspecting your Electron app's database. Query from terminal: `sqlite3 db.sqlite "SELECT * FROM users"`. Interactive mode offers `.schema`, `.tables`, and `.dump` commands. Install via `winget install SQLite.SQLite`.

## Git configuration prevents Windows line ending nightmares

Line ending conflicts between Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF) cause false diffs, broken bash scripts, and linting errors. The correct configuration depends on whether you use `.gitattributes` (recommended) or global Git settings.

**Use `.gitattributes` for repository-level control** that applies to all contributors regardless of their OS:

```
# .gitattributes at repository root
* text=auto

# Force LF for cross-platform files
*.js text eol=lf
*.ts text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.md text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf

# Force CRLF for Windows-specific files
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# Binary files
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
```

This approach overrides user settings and ensures consistent line endings across the team. The `* text=auto` directive tells Git to automatically detect text files and normalize them to LF in the repository while checking out with platform-appropriate endings.

**Set global Git configuration for Windows development**:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true       # Convert CRLF→LF on commit, LF→CRLF on checkout
git config --global core.longpaths true      # Enable long path support
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Performance improvements
git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global core.fscache true
git config --global gc.auto 256
```

The `core.autocrlf true` setting ensures your local files use CRLF for Windows compatibility while the repository stores LF, preventing line ending conflicts when collaborating with Unix developers.

**Configure VS Code and Prettier** to respect LF endings:

```json
{
  "files.eol": "\n",
  "prettier.endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

For existing repositories with inconsistent line endings, normalize them with:

```bash
git rm -rf --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
```

## VS Code with Copilot provides the best value for large TypeScript codebases

After evaluating Cursor and VS Code for TypeScript/Electron/React development on a 50,000-line codebase, **VS Code emerges as the more practical choice** for most developers. With 75.9% market share among developers (2025 Stack Overflow Survey), VS Code offers mature tooling, excellent performance optimizations, and multiple AI options at lower cost.

### VS Code advantages for TypeScript/Electron development

**Native TypeScript support is best-in-class**. VS Code uses the same TypeScript language server that powers IntelliSense, error detection, and refactoring in production. The September 2024 ESM migration reduced bundle size by 10%+ and dramatically improved startup performance. Combined with the upcoming TypeScript 7 native port (8-10x faster compilation), VS Code's TypeScript experience will become even more responsive for large codebases.

**Electron debugging works seamlessly** since VS Code itself is an Electron application built by Microsoft. Configure both main process (Node.js debugger) and renderer process (Chrome DevTools) debugging simultaneously with source map support. The official Electron documentation provides battle-tested launch configurations that work immediately.

**GitHub Copilot now offers a free tier** (announced December 2024) with limited completions and chat messages—making AI-assisted coding accessible without upfront cost. The Pro tier costs $10/month for unlimited completions, access to GPT-4 and Claude models, and advanced features like Copilot Edits (multi-file editing) and Agent Mode (autonomous coding). For developers wanting open-source alternatives, Continue.dev provides full AI capabilities with model flexibility (OpenAI, Claude, local models) at zero cost for individuals.

**Extension ecosystem remains unmatched** with 60,000+ extensions covering every development need. Essential extensions for your stack: ESLint (11M installs), Prettier (24M installs), SQLite viewers, React snippet collections, and GitLens (26M installs) for git integration. While Cursor technically supports VS Code extensions, Microsoft began blocking key extensions (C/C++, C# DevKit) in April 2025, creating compatibility headaches.

**Performance with 50k+ line codebases requires optimization but is manageable**. Memory usage typically ranges from 800-1500MB for large TypeScript projects, with TypeScript language server consuming an additional 200-500MB. Enable `typescript.tsserver.maxTsServerMemory: 4096` in settings, exclude node_modules from file watchers, and use TypeScript project references for monorepos to maintain responsiveness.

**Terminal integration is excellent** with shell integration that detects working directories, command boundaries, and exit codes. The `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+\`` shortcut now opens terminals in separate windows. Combined with persistent sessions across reloads, VS Code's terminal handles complex development workflows smoothly.

**SQLite inspection works through extensions**. The SQLite (alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite) extension with 2M installs provides database explorer, query execution, and export capabilities. Right-click any `.db` file and select "Open Database" to browse tables and run queries without leaving the editor—perfect for inspecting your Electron app's encrypted case management database.

**React development includes built-in JSX/TSX support** with IntelliSense for component props, hooks, and imports. Hot reload works out-of-box with Vite, Create React App, and Next.js. The ES7+ React/Redux snippets extension (8M installs) provides comprehensive TypeScript-compatible snippets for rapid component development.

### Cursor strengths and critical limitations

**Cursor's AI integration is genuinely revolutionary**. The Composer mode generates code across multiple files with git-diff visualization, while Agent Mode autonomously completes tasks including terminal commands and debugging. Multiple developers report 2-5x productivity improvements for greenfield projects and rapid prototyping. The AI understands TypeScript patterns, React component structure, and Electron-specific code better than Copilot in many scenarios.

However, **critical performance and reliability issues undermine these advantages**:

**Memory consumption is excessive**. Multiple users report 3-7GB RAM usage regularly, with crashes on systems that should handle the workload easily. One developer with 64GB RAM reported hourly crashes and reboots. Cursor Helper and Renderer processes combined consume over 7GB in documented cases—unacceptable for professional development.

**Extension compatibility problems are significant**. Microsoft blocked major extensions (C/C++ with 81M installs, C# DevKit) in April 2025 for violating marketplace terms. Extensions lag behind VS Code versions, requiring manual .vsix installation. For C++ developers (relevant for node-gyp native modules), this is a critical limitation.

**Context limitations emerge with large codebases**. Multiple reviews note that Cursor works well with focused contexts but struggles beyond 50k-100k lines of code. It hallucinates imports, forgets type relationships in shared utilities, and sometimes deletes features during large refactors. The AI's effectiveness degrades as project complexity increases—precisely when you'd most need assistance.

**Security vulnerabilities created concern in 2025**. CVE-2025-54135 and CVE-2025-54136 allowed prompt injection and remote code execution through malicious MCP configurations and GitHub repos. While patched in version 1.3, the incidents highlight risks of AI-first architectures. Additionally, malicious npm packages specifically targeted Cursor users on macOS, infecting 3,200+ users between February-May 2025.

**Cost is double that of Copilot** at $20/month versus $10/month for GitHub Copilot Pro. While Cursor's AI capabilities justify the premium for some developers, the value proposition weakens given VS Code's improving AI features and Continue.dev's free open-source alternative.

### Head-to-head comparison for your specific stack

| Category | VS Code + Copilot | Cursor |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **TypeScript IntelliSense** | ⭐⭐⭐ Best-in-class, TypeScript 7 improving | ⭐⭐⭐ Inherits from VS Code |
| **Electron debugging** | ⭐⭐⭐ Native, battle-tested | ⭐⭐⭐ Inherits from VS Code |
| **AI code generation** | ⭐⭐ Good (Copilot/Continue) | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent (Composer/Agent) |
| **Performance (50k LOC)** | ⭐⭐⭐ 800-1500MB, optimizable | ⭐ 3-7GB, frequent crashes |
| **Extension compatibility** | ⭐⭐⭐ 60k extensions, full access | ⭐⭐ Blocked extensions, version lag |
| **React/JSX support** | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent built-in | ⭐⭐⭐ Inherits from VS Code |
| **SQLite tools** | ⭐⭐⭐ Multiple extensions | ⭐⭐⭐ Same extensions |
| **Cost** | 💰 $0-10/month | 💰💰 $20/month |
| **Reliability** | ⭐⭐⭐ Rock solid | ⭐⭐ Crashes, refactoring issues |
| **Learning curve** | ⭐⭐⭐ Gentle | ⭐⭐ New paradigm |
| **Large codebase handling** | ⭐⭐⭐ Proven at scale | ⭐⭐ Context limitations |

**Recommendation: Start with VS Code + GitHub Copilot Free**. The free tier provides genuine AI assistance with no financial commitment. As needs grow, upgrade to Copilot Pro ($10/month) or experiment with Continue.dev for open-source flexibility. If you're actively prototyping new features and have powerful hardware (32GB+ RAM), try Cursor's 2-week Pro trial to evaluate whether the AI capabilities justify the performance tradeoffs and higher cost.

For maintaining and debugging your existing 50,000-line TypeScript/Electron/React application, VS Code's stability, performance, and comprehensive debugging tools make it the more reliable choice. Cursor's AI shines for greenfield development but struggles with the complexity of large established codebases—precisely your scenario.

## Workflow optimization accelerates development velocity

Beyond editor and terminal choice, specific tooling decisions and configurations dramatically impact productivity for large TypeScript/Electron projects.

### electron-vite provides optimal build performance

**electron-vite** is purpose-built for Electron+Vite projects, offering pre-configured setups with HMR for renderer and hot reload for main process. Install via `npm install electron-vite -D` or scaffold with `npm create @quick-start/electron@latest`.

Key optimizations:

```javascript
// electron.vite.config.js
import { defineConfig, externalizeDepsPlugin } from 'electron-vite'

export default defineConfig({
  main: {
    plugins: [externalizeDepsPlugin()],
    build: {
      rollupOptions: {
        external: ['better-sqlite3'],  // Exclude native modules
        output: { manualChunks: { vendor: ['electron'] } }
      }
    }
  },
  renderer: {
    build: {
      target: 'esnext',
      rollupOptions: {
        output: { manualChunks: { react: ['react', 'react-dom'] } }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

**Manual chunking** separates vendor code (React, Electron) from application code, enabling better caching and faster rebuilds. The `externalizeDepsPlugin()` prevents bundling node_modules into the main process, reducing bundle size and avoiding native module issues.

**Persistent caching** with `cacheDir: '.vite'` stores optimized dependencies, making subsequent builds dramatically faster. For cold starts, enable `optimizeDeps: { include: ['react', 'react-dom'] }` to pre-bundle frequently used dependencies.

### Vitest and Playwright integration for comprehensive testing

With 1,100+ tests across 40 test files, efficient test workflows are critical. **Vitest's watch mode** (`vitest --watch`) provides instant feedback as you modify code, running only affected tests.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

**Vitest Browser Mode** (released 2024) uses Playwright internally for browser testing, unifying unit and integration tests under a single framework. Configure with:

```javascript
// vitest.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      enabled: true,
      provider: 'playwright',
      instances: [{ browser: 'chromium' }]
    }
  }
})
```

Run Playwright E2E tests separately with `npx playwright test` for full application workflows. The combined Vitest + Playwright setup provides fast unit tests, browser-based component tests, and comprehensive E2E coverage in a single toolchain.

### Git automation with Husky and lint-staged

**Enforce code quality automatically** with pre-commit hooks that run TypeScript checking, ESLint, and Prettier before each commit:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky init
```

Configure in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix --max-warnings 0",
      "prettier --write",
      "bash -c 'tsc --noEmit'"
    ]
  }
}
```

The pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) runs:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npx lint-staged
```

This workflow catches type errors, style violations, and linting issues before they reach your repository—critical for maintaining code quality as a solo developer without code review.

**Commit message templates** enforce consistency. Create `.gitmessage`:

```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

Enable with `git config --local commit.template .gitmessage`. Each commit prompts you with the template, encouraging clear, structured commit messages that aid future code archaeology.

### SQLite migration workflow for database evolution

Your encrypted case management system requires reliable database migrations. **better-sqlite3-migrations** provides version-controlled schema evolution:

```javascript
import Database from 'better-sqlite3'
import { migrate } from '@blackglory/better-sqlite3-migrations'

const db = new Database('app.db')

const migrations = [
  {
    version: 1,
    up: 'CREATE TABLE cases (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, encrypted_data BLOB)',
    down: 'DROP TABLE cases'
  },
  {
    version: 2,
    up: db => {
      db.exec('ALTER TABLE cases ADD COLUMN created_at TEXT')
      db.exec('UPDATE cases SET created_at = datetime("now")')
    },
    down: 'ALTER TABLE cases DROP COLUMN created_at'
  }
]

migrate(db, migrations)
```

Migrations run automatically on app startup, applying only new versions. The `version` field tracks progress using SQLite's `PRAGMA user_version`.

**GUI inspection tools** complement CLI workflows. **DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S)** is free, open-source, and provides visual editing, schema visualization, and SQL query execution. **Beekeeper Studio** offers a modern UI with autocomplete and multiple tabs. Install DB4S via `winget install DB.Browser.for.SQLite` for quick database inspection during development.

### Local CI/CD testing with act

**Avoid "works on my machine" CI failures** by testing GitHub Actions locally before pushing. Act runs workflows in Docker containers on your development machine:

```bash
choco install act-cli
act -l                    # List workflows
act push                  # Test push event
act -j test               # Run specific job
```

Configure defaults in `.actrc`:

```
-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
--container-architecture linux/amd64
```

This workflow catches configuration errors, missing environment variables, and dependency issues before they block CI/CD pipelines—saving time and frustration.

### Build caching for faster iterations

**Vite's automatic caching** in `node_modules/.vite` dramatically speeds up subsequent builds. Preserve this directory for instant dev server starts. Force cache invalidation when needed with `vite --force` or delete `.vite` manually.

**TypeScript incremental compilation** reduces type-checking time on rebuilds:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "incremental": true,
    "tsBuildInfoFile": ".tsbuildinfo"
  }
}
```

**GitHub Actions cache** speeds up CI/CD:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      node_modules
      .vite
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

Combined, these caching strategies reduce build times by 50-70%, compounding time savings across hundreds of daily builds.

### Code navigation for 50,000-line codebases

**VS Code shortcuts** are essential muscle memory for large projects:
- `Ctrl+P` - Quick file open with fuzzy search
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` - Global search across all files
- `Ctrl+T` - Go to symbol (functions, classes, types)
- `F12` - Go to definition
- `Shift+F12` - Find all references
- `Alt+Left/Right` - Navigate backward/forward through code locations

**ripgrep integration** provides faster global search than VS Code's default. Install ripgrep and VS Code uses it automatically for `Ctrl+Shift+F` searches—10x faster on large codebases.

**Dependency visualization** helps understand architecture. Install madge globally (`npm install -g madge`) and generate dependency graphs:

```bash
madge --image graph.png src/index.ts
madge --circular src  # Find circular dependencies
```

For 50,000-line projects, circular dependencies create slow compilation and runtime issues. Madge identifies them immediately, guiding refactoring efforts.

## Windows-specific configurations prevent common pain points

Native Windows development requires proactive configuration to avoid file system limitations, performance issues, and compatibility problems.

### Enable long path support immediately

Windows' 260-character MAX_PATH limit devastates Node.js projects with deeply nested `node_modules`. Enable long paths via PowerShell (run as Administrator):

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

Additionally configure Git:

```bash
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

**Keep project paths short** even with long path support enabled. Place projects near the root (`C:\dev\` instead of `C:\Users\username\Documents\Projects\`) to minimize path length accumulation. Use the `subst` command to map long paths to drive letters if necessary: `subst X: C:\very\long\path\to\project`.

### Windows Defender exclusions dramatically improve performance

Real-time scanning causes 2-4x slower npm installs and builds due to constant file inspection. **Exclude development directories and processes** via PowerShell (Administrator):

```powershell
# Processes
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "node.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "npm.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "git.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "Code.exe"

# Directories
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\dev"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:APPDATA\npm"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:APPDATA\npm-cache"
```

**Security consideration**: Only exclude development directories, not system folders or production code. Understand the security implications for your organization before implementing exclusions.

The performance improvement is immediate and substantial. npm install operations that took 2-3 minutes often complete in under 60 seconds after exclusions.

### WSL2 versus native Windows for Electron development

**Electron development strongly favors native Windows** for several reasons:

**Native module compilation works reliably** on Windows with proper build tools installed. WSL2 introduces complexity when building native modules like better-sqlite3—they must target the Linux environment but often need Windows binaries for Electron packaging.

**GUI integration is simpler** on native Windows. Electron apps are windowed applications, and debugging GUI behavior in native Windows eliminates WSL2's additional abstraction layer.

**File performance on native Windows is acceptable** with proper configuration (Defender exclusions, short paths, long path support). While WSL2 offers faster npm operations when files reside in the Linux filesystem, accessing Windows files from WSL2 (via `/mnt/c/`) is 3-10x slower—worse than native Windows performance.

**Use WSL2 if**: You're deploying to Linux servers, need Linux-specific build tools, or prefer bash/zsh over PowerShell. Store projects in the Linux filesystem (`~/projects`) rather than Windows mounts (`/mnt/c/`) for acceptable performance.

**Use native Windows if**: You're building Electron applications (your case), need native Windows APIs, use PowerShell, or want simpler tooling integration. Configure properly (Defender exclusions, long paths) for optimal performance.

For your 50,000-line TypeScript/Electron/React application with Windows-native deployment, **stick with native Windows development**. The tooling integration is more straightforward, and Electron's native module ecosystem works more reliably.

### PowerShell execution policy for development

PowerShell's default `Restricted` policy prevents running scripts, blocking npm operations and build scripts. **Set RemoteSigned for CurrentUser scope**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

This allows local scripts to run while requiring remote scripts to be signed—balancing security and development convenience. Never set `Unrestricted` globally or use `LocalMachine` scope, which affects all users.

For temporary script execution without policy changes:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1
```

### node-gyp configuration for native modules

better-sqlite3 and other native modules require C++ compilation tools. **Automated installation** (recommended):

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015
```

This downloads Visual Studio Build Tools (3-8GB) and configures everything automatically—takes 30+ minutes but handles all dependencies.

**Manual installation** for more control:
1. Install Python 3.x from Microsoft Store or python.org
2. Download Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with C++" workload
3. Configure npm:

```bash
npm config set python python3
npm config set msvs_version 2019  # Or 2017, 2022
```

**Common error solutions**:
- "Can't find Python": `npm config set python /path/to/python`
- "MSBuild not found": `npm config set msvs_version 2019`
- Module rebuild fails: `npm cache clean --force && npm rebuild`

### Complete Windows setup script

Combine all Windows-specific configurations into a single setup script:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator

# Enable long paths
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" `
  -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force

# Set execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force

# Windows Defender exclusions
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "node.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "npm.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "git.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "Code.exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\dev"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:APPDATA\npm"

# Git configuration
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git config --global core.longpaths true
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# npm configuration
npm config set python python3
npm config set msvs_version 2019

Write-Host "Windows development environment configured successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Restart PowerShell for changes to take effect" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

Save as `setup-windows-dev.ps1` and run once on new development machines.

## Key takeaways for Windows native TypeScript/Electron development

Native Windows development has reached parity with Unix-based systems when properly configured. The maturation of Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7+, and Windows-native tooling eliminates most historical disadvantages while preserving Windows-specific benefits like native Electron debugging and GUI integration.

**Start with Windows Terminal and PowerShell 7+** configured with Oh My Posh, PSReadLine, and Terminal-Icons. This combination delivers professional-grade terminal experience with git integration, command prediction, and visual file navigation—essentials for managing large codebases.

**Choose pnpm for package management** to gain 3x installation speed and 70% disk space reduction compared to npm. The strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies that cause production bugs, while monorepo support provides scaling options if your project grows beyond a single package.

**VS Code with GitHub Copilot represents the best value** for most developers. The free tier provides genuine AI assistance, the $10/month Pro tier offers unlimited completions with multiple models, and Continue.dev delivers open-source flexibility without cost. Cursor's advanced AI capabilities are impressive but undermined by excessive memory consumption (3-7GB), frequent crashes, extension compatibility issues, and context limitations with large codebases—precisely your 50,000-line scenario.

**Proactively configure Windows-specific settings** to avoid common pitfalls. Enable long path support immediately, add Windows Defender exclusions for development directories (2-4x performance improvement), configure Git line endings via .gitattributes, set PowerShell execution policy to RemoteSigned, and install Visual Studio Build Tools for native module compilation. This 30-minute upfront investment prevents weeks of cumulative frustration.

**Optimize your workflow with electron-vite, Vitest, and Husky**. These tools transform large-scale TypeScript/Electron development by providing instant HMR feedback, comprehensive testing with watch mode, and automated quality gates through pre-commit hooks. Combined with CLI tools like ripgrep, fzf, and gh, they create a development environment that rivals or exceeds Unix-based alternatives.

For your specific project—50,000 lines of TypeScript, Electron 28+, React 18, Vite, SQLite with better-sqlite3, and 1,100+ tests—this native Windows configuration delivers professional-grade performance, reliability, and developer experience without the complexity and overhead of WSL2. The tooling has matured to the point where Windows is no longer a compromise but a first-class platform for modern JavaScript development.
