Dear Sarah,

RE: TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

Further to our meeting on 12 August 2024, I am writing to confirm that your employment with TechCorp Solutions Ltd will terminate with immediate effect.

Despite completing your Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in July 2024, we have continued to observe performance concerns that do not meet the standards required for your role as Senior Software Developer.

The company is undergoing modernization and requires a development team with skills aligned to our new strategic direction. After careful consideration, we have concluded that your skill set no longer aligns with our future needs.

Your final salary payment will include:
- Salary up to and including 15 August 2024
- Accrued but unused annual leave (10 days)
- Ex-gratia payment of £16,250 (3 months' salary in lieu of notice)

We require you to return all company property, including your laptop, access cards, and mobile phone by close of business today.

We wish you well in your future endeavors.

Yours sincerely,

James Thompson
Chief Executive Officer
TechCorp Solutions Ltd
