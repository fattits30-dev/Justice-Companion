Hi Test User,

I wanted to check in regarding your Performance Improvement Plan objectives. We're now in week 3 of the 8-week plan.

Current status:
- Mobile app project: 45% complete (target: 60% by this point)
- Code review feedback: 2 out of 3 reviews completed, mixed feedback on code quality
- Knowledge sharing session: Not yet scheduled

Could we schedule a meeting for tomorrow to discuss progress and any blockers you're facing?

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Engineering Manager

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for checking in. I've been working on the mobile app project but have encountered some technical challenges with the new framework. The legacy system integration is proving more complex than anticipated.

I can meet tomorrow at 10 AM. I'll prepare a detailed status update.

Regards,
Test User
Lead Developer

Subject: PIP Extension Required - Test User
Date: 15 August 2024 09:15

Dear Amanda and HR Team,

After our meeting yesterday with Test User, it's clear that the current PIP timeline is unrealistic given the technical complexity of the mobile application project.

Test User has made progress but needs additional time to:
1. Complete the mobile app migration
2. Address the code quality concerns identified in peer reviews
3. Complete the required cloud certification

I recommend extending the PIP by 4 weeks to 15 October 2024. This will give Test User a fair opportunity to demonstrate improvement.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Engineering Manager

Sarah,

Thank you for the update. Given the strategic importance of the mobile app project and Test User's experience with our legacy systems, I approve the 4-week extension.

However, please ensure that all PIP objectives are clearly documented and that Test User understands the consequences of not meeting the extended deadlines.

We need to make a decision by mid-October regarding the restructuring and potential redundancies in the development team.

Best regards,
Dr. Amanda Chen
Chief Technology Officer
