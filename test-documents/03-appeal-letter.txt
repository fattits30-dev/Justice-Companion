Dear Mrs Holmes,

RE: APPEAL AGAINST DISMISSAL - EMPLOYEE REFERENCE BT-4521

I am writing to formally appeal my dismissal dated 12th November 2025, reference BT/HR/2025/0847.

GROUNDS FOR APPEAL

I believe my dismissal was unfair and procedurally improper for the following reasons:

1. INADEQUATE INVESTIGATION

The investigation was rushed and one-sided. Key evidence supporting my innocence was ignored:
- My line manager, Robert Chen, confirmed he approved all disputed expense claims
- I was not shown the "evidence" of alleged confidentiality breach before the hearing
- No attempt was made to verify my explanations or speak to relevant witnesses

2. BREACH OF PROCEDURE

The company failed to follow its own disciplinary procedure as outlined in the Employee Handbook (Section 12):
- I was given only 7 days' notice of the disciplinary hearing, not the required 10 days
- I was denied access to all evidence being used against me before the hearing
- My request for postponement to arrange union representation was refused

3. PREDETERMINED OUTCOME

The dismissal decision appears to have been made before the hearing took place:
- Mr Thompson made comments to other employees about "cleaning house"
- The dismissal letter was dated 12th November but I received it at 8am on the 13th, before the appeal deadline was even set
- I was asked to clear my desk immediately after the hearing, suggesting the outcome was predetermined

4. LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR GROSS MISCONDUCT

The allegations do not meet the threshold for gross misconduct:

a) Expense Claims: All claims were legitimate and approved. I have retained copies of all receipts and can provide witness testimony from clients.

b) Confidentiality Breach: The document in question was a publicly available industry report that I shared for legitimate business purposes.

c) Equipment Misuse: Using company equipment for occasional personal use is common practice and has never been raised as an issue before. This is not gross misconduct.

5. ALTERNATIVE MOTIVES

I believe the real reason for my dismissal relates to the grievance I raised on 15th September 2025 regarding gender discrimination in the allocation of the Senior Developer promotion, which was given to a less qualified male colleague. This dismissal appears to be retaliation for that grievance.

REMEDY SOUGHT

I request:
1. Reinstatement to my position with immediate effect
2. Full back pay for any period of dismissal
3. Removal of all disciplinary records from my file
4. A formal apology for the unfair treatment

Alternatively, if reinstatement is not possible, I seek compensation for unfair dismissal and victimisation.

NEXT STEPS

If my appeal is unsuccessful, I intend to pursue a claim at the Employment Tribunal. I have already obtained early conciliation through ACAS (Certificate Number: R123456/25/78).

I am available for an appeal hearing at your earliest convenience and request that Mr Thompson not be involved in the appeal decision given his apparent predetermination.

Please confirm receipt of this appeal within 2 working days.

Yours sincerely,
