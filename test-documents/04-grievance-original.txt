FORMAL GRIEVANCE

Department: Software Development

SUBJECT: Gender Discrimination in Promotion Decision

Dear Mrs Holmes,

I am writing to raise a formal grievance under the company's Grievance Procedure regarding the decision to promote Mr. James Harrison to the position of Senior Developer Team Lead, a position for which I was also a candidate.

BACKGROUND

I have worked at Brightstone Technologies for 4 years and 8 months. During this time:
- I have consistently received "Exceeds Expectations" in all performance reviews
- I have led the successful delivery of 3 major projects (Phoenix, Aurora, and Titan)
- I have mentored 6 junior developers, all of whom have progressed well
- I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science and AWS Solutions Architect certification

Mr. Harrison has been employed for 2 years and 3 months and:
- Has led 1 project which was delivered late and over budget
- Has no formal mentoring record
- Holds a Bachelor's degree with no additional certifications

DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT

Despite my superior qualifications and track record, the promotion was awarded to Mr. Harrison. During my feedback meeting with Mr. Thompson on 10th July 2024, he made the following comments:

"James is just a better fit for leading the team"
"He has the right presence for client meetings"
"The team needs strong leadership" (emphasis on 'strong')

When I asked for specific areas where Mr. Harrison outperformed me, Mr. Thompson could not provide any concrete examples.

I believe these comments, combined with the decision itself, constitute direct discrimination on the grounds of sex, contrary to Section 13 of the Equality Act 2010.

PREVIOUS PATTERNS

This is not an isolated incident. In the past 18 months:
- The development department has promoted 4 male colleagues and 0 female colleagues
- Female developers are consistently assigned to "support" roles rather than leadership positions
- Pay gap analysis (which I obtained through a subject access request) shows male developers earn on average 15% more than female developers at the same grade level

RESOLUTION SOUGHT

I request:
1. A review of the promotion decision with an independent panel
2. Fair reconsideration of my candidacy based on objective criteria
3. A review of the department's promotion and pay practices
4. Compensation for the distress and financial loss caused

I expect this grievance to be handled confidentially and without any detriment to my employment.

Please confirm receipt within 3 working days and arrange a grievance meeting within the timeframe specified in the Employee Handbook.

Yours sincerely,


Sarah Mitchell
