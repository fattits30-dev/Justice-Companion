SUBJECT: RE: Disciplinary Investigation - Urgent Response Required

Dear Jennifer,

I am extremely concerned about the allegations outlined in your email dated 3rd September. I categorically deny any wrongdoing and believe there has been a serious misunderstanding.

Regarding the expense claims:
- All expenses submitted were legitimate business costs incurred during client visits
- I have receipts and client meeting notes for every claim
- My line manager, Mr. Robert Chen, approved all these expenses at the time

Regarding the confidentiality breach:
- I have never shared confidential information outside the company
- The document referenced was a publicly available industry report, not proprietary data

Regarding misuse of equipment:
- Using the company laptop for occasional personal emails during lunch breaks is standard practice across the entire department

I request to see all evidence being used against me and to have a fair hearing with union representation present.

Kind regards,
testuser555

SUBJECT: RE: Expense Claim Query

Hi Sarah,

Yes, I remember approving those expense claims. The client meetings in Leeds and Birmingham were essential for the Phoenix project deliverables. I don't understand why Finance is querying these now - they've had the supporting documentation since February.

Happy to provide a statement to HR if needed.

Best,
Robert

SUBJECT: Expense Claim Query

Hi Robert,

I've just received a strange email from Finance questioning my expense claims from Q1 and Q2. These were all approved by you at the time and relate to the Phoenix project client visits.

Can you confirm you remember approving these? The claims were:
- 15th Jan: Leeds client visit - £312.50
- 3rd Feb: Birmingham site inspection - £485.00
- 22nd March: Leeds follow-up - £298.75
- 8th April: Manchester client dinner - £156.80
- Plus various travel expenses

Something doesn't feel right about this.

Thanks,
testuser555
