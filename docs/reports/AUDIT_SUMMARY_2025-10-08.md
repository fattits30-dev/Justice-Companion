# Quick Audit Summary - 2025-10-08

## TL;DR

**616 files audited** across automation/, docs/, scripts/, and root .md files

**Key Finding**: 425 orphaned artifact files (70% of total) from Oct 6-7 beta testing can be archived immediately.

---

## Top Recommendations (Priority Order)

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Archive Beta Testing Artifacts
**Impact**: Clear 425 stale files (events, suggestions, tasks, fixes)
**Risk**: Low - these are generated outputs, not referenced anywhere
**Time**: 5 minutes

```bash
mkdir -p automation/archive/2025-10-06-beta/{events,suggestions,tasks,fixes,results}
mv automation/events/*.json automation/archive/2025-10-06-beta/events/
mv automation/suggestions/*.{json,txt} automation/archive/2025-10-06-beta/suggestions/
mv automation/tasks/*.json automation/archive/2025-10-06-beta/tasks/
mv automation/fixes/*.json automation/archive/2025-10-06-beta/fixes/
```

### 2. NEAR-TERM: Consolidate Root Documentation
**Impact**: Reduce root clutter from 21 .md files to 3 essential files
**Risk**: Low - just moving files to docs/, update CLAUDE.md links
**Time**: 15 minutes

Keep in root:
- CLAUDE.md (primary dev guide)
- AGENTS.md (repository guidelines)
- TESTING.md (primary testing docs)

Move to docs/:
- 9 completed work reports → docs/reports/
- 4 implementation docs → docs/implementation/
- 6 testing guides → docs/testing/

### 3. FUTURE: Organize Automation Docs
**Impact**: Cleaner automation/ directory structure
**Risk**: Low - internal reorganization
**Time**: 20 minutes

Create automation/docs/ with subdirectories and move 15+ .md files from automation/ root.

## What's Already Clean

✅ **scripts/** - All 8 TypeScript files are active, referenced in package.json
✅ **docs/** - Well-organized with api/, architecture/, implementation/, phases/ subdirectories
✅ **automation/scripts/** - All 12 Python files actively used by orchestrator
✅ **automation/agents/** - All 4 agent modules active
✅ **automation/tests/** - All 5 test files active (72 tests, 100% pass rate)
