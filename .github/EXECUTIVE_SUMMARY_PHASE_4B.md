## Critical Findings

### P0 - Must Fix Before Production (2-4 weeks)

#### 1. Code Signing Certificates Missing ⚠️

**Impact:** Users see security warnings:
- Windows: "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)
- macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened" (Gatekeeper)

**Solution:**
- Windows EV certificate: $300-600/year (DigiCert recommended)
- Apple Developer Program: $99/year
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (procurement + validation)

**Business Impact:**
- 40-60% of users abandon installations with security warnings
- Critical for enterprise adoption

#### 2. IPC Handler Testing Gap ❌

**Impact:** Security-critical code untested (0% coverage)

**Risk:** Authorization bypass vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.5)

**Solution:**
- Write comprehensive IPC handler tests
- Target: 90%+ coverage
- **Timeline:** 1 week

#### 3. E2E Tests Not Running in CI ⚠️

**Impact:** No end-to-end validation in pipeline

**Risk:** Regression bugs in production

**Solution:**
- Enable Playwright tests in CI
- Verify tests pass on Ubuntu + Windows
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days

#### 4. Application Monitoring Missing ❌

**Impact:** No visibility into production crashes, errors

**Solution:**
- Integrate Sentry (free tier: 5,000 events/month)
- Configure crash reporting
- Add performance metrics
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days

**Alternative:** Custom error tracking ($5-10/month)

---

## P1 - High Priority (Post-Launch)

1. **Auto-Update System** (not configured)
   - Impact: Users must manually download updates
   - Solution: Configure electron-updater with GitHub Releases
   - Timeline: 3-5 days

2. **Incident Response Runbook** (missing)
   - Impact: Delayed response to production issues
   - Solution: Document severity levels, procedures, SLAs
   - Timeline: 2-3 days

3. **Performance Regression Detection** (missing thresholds)
   - Impact: Performance degradation may go unnoticed
   - Solution: Define SLOs, add threshold checks
   - Timeline: 1 week
