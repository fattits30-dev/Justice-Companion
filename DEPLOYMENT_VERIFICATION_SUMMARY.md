## Critical Findings

### üî¥ BLOCKER #1: Missing pnpm-lock.yaml

**Impact:** Cannot install dependencies, run tests, or build application

**Root Cause:** `pnpm-lock.yaml` was deleted from repository

**Evidence:**
- Git status shows: `D pnpm-lock.yaml`
- ESLint error: `Cannot find package '@eslint/js'`
- TypeScript error: `Cannot find type definition file for 'node'`

**Resolution:** See `CRITICAL_BLOCKER_FIX_GUIDE.md`

**Time to Fix:** 15-30 minutes

---

### üî¥ BLOCKER #2: Unverified Build System

**Impact:** Cannot confirm production builds work

**Root Cause:** Build system cannot run due to missing dependencies (BLOCKER #1)

**Resolution:**
1. Fix BLOCKER #1 first
2. Run full build verification
3. Test multi-platform builds

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (after BLOCKER #1)

---

### üî¥ BLOCKER #3: Unverified Test Suite

**Impact:** Cannot confirm no regressions introduced

**Root Cause:** Tests cannot run due to missing dependencies (BLOCKER #1)

**Resolution:**
1. Fix BLOCKER #1 first
2. Rebuild better-sqlite3 for Node runtime
3. Run full test suite
4. Verify 99.7%+ pass rate

**Time to Fix:** 30-60 minutes (after BLOCKER #1)

---
