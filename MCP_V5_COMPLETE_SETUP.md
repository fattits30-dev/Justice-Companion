## Configuration Strategy

### Hybrid Approach

**Direct executables (memory, sequential-thinking):**
- Full paths to `.cmd` files
- Faster startup (no npx overhead)
- Offline operation
- Explicit version control

**npx-based (playwright, context7, github, puppeteer):**
- Use `@latest` for auto-updates
- Easier to maintain (npm handles versioning)
- No need to track executable paths
- Trade-off: Slight startup delay for cache validation

**Why this split?**
- Core MCPs (memory, sequential-thinking) are stable and critical
- Specialized MCPs (testing, docs, github) benefit from auto-updates
- Balance between performance and maintainability

---

## Environment Variables

### Required

**GITHUB_TOKEN** (for github MCP):
```bash
# Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Permissions needed: repo (full control of private repositories)

# Add to .env:
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Or set system-wide:
# Windows: setx GITHUB_TOKEN "ghp_your_token_here"
# Linux/Mac: export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

### Optional

**PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_OPTIONS** (for puppeteer MCP):
```bash
PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_OPTIONS={"headless":true}
```

**ALLOW_DANGEROUS** (for puppeteer MCP):
```bash
ALLOW_DANGEROUS=true  # Use with caution
```

---

## Use Cases by MCP

### For Development

**memory:**
- Store coding patterns: "Remember that we use Zod for validation"
- Recall decisions: "What did we decide about database migrations?"
- Track bugs: "Remember this fix for better-sqlite3 rebuild issues"

**context7:**
- Get latest docs: "use context7 to get Electron 38 IPC documentation"
- Check API changes: "use context7 to see what's new in React 19"
- Find examples: "use context7 to show Drizzle ORM query examples"

**sequential-thinking:**
- Architecture decisions: "Design a new GDPR data export system"
- Complex refactoring: "How should we refactor the encryption service?"
- Security analysis: "Analyze the KeyManager for vulnerabilities"

---

### For Testing

**playwright:**
- E2E test generation: "Create Playwright tests for authentication flow"
- UI automation: "Generate test code for creating a new case"
- Accessibility testing: "Verify login screen accessibility with Playwright"

**puppeteer:**
- Web scraping tests: "Test legal research by scraping test data"
- Screenshot generation: "Capture screenshots of all major screens"
- Form automation: "Test document generation forms"

---

### For GitHub Operations

**github:**
- Issue management: "Create issue for implementing data portability"
- PR creation: "Create PR for KeyManager encryption fixes"
- Code search: "Search for uses of EncryptionService in codebase"
- Repo management: "List all open PRs with label 'security'"

---

### For Legal Research (Justice Companion Specific)

**puppeteer:**
- Legislation scraping: "Scrape recent Data Protection Acts from legislation.gov.uk"
- Case law extraction: "Extract cases related to GDPR from caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk"
- Citation verification: "Verify legal citations by scraping source documents"
- Automated research: "Find all legislation mentioning 'right to erasure'"

**context7:**
- Legal API docs: "use context7 to get API docs for UK case law archives"
- Framework updates: "use context7 to check for OpenAI API changes"

---

## Comparison: Playwright vs Puppeteer

### Playwright

**Pros:**
- ✅ Accessibility tree-based (no screenshots needed)
- ✅ Faster and more reliable
- ✅ Better for structured UI testing
- ✅ Cross-browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- ✅ Microsoft official support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less flexible for dynamic content
- ❌ Steeper learning curve

**Best for:**
- E2E testing of Justice Companion UI
- Automated regression testing
- Accessibility validation
- CI/CD test automation

---

### Puppeteer

**Pros:**
- ✅ Great for web scraping
- ✅ JavaScript execution in browser
- ✅ Screenshot capabilities
- ✅ Form automation
- ✅ Good for dynamic content

**Cons:**
- ❌ Screenshot-dependent (slower)
- ❌ Chromium only
- ❌ Deprecated npm package

**Best for:**
- Scraping UK legal websites
- Extracting legal data
- Screenshot generation
- JavaScript-heavy sites

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub MCP fails with "No token" error

**Cause:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` not set

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add to .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_personal_access_token

# Or set system-wide
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "ghp_your_token_here"

# Restart Claude Code
```

---

### Issue: Playwright/Puppeteer slow to start

**Cause:** npx downloads package on first use

**Fix:**
```bash
# Pre-install globally to speed up startup
npm install -g @playwright/mcp @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
```

---

### Issue: Context7 returns "No documentation found"

**Cause:** Library not indexed by Context7

**Fix:**
- Use WebFetch for library documentation instead
- Or use official docs URL directly

---

### Issue: MCPs not appearing in /mcp list

**Cause:** JSON syntax error in .mcp.json

**Fix:**
```bash
# Validate JSON
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.mcp.json', 'utf8'))"

# If errors, fix syntax and restart Claude Code
```

---

### Issue: "Package no longer supported" warnings

**Status:** Known issue for `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`

**Impact:** Warnings only - packages still work

**Future:** Watch for new official packages:
- github/github-mcp-server (GitHub's new MCP)
- Playwright may release new MCP versions

**Current recommendation:** Use deprecated packages until new ones are available

---

## Performance Impact

### Startup Time

**Before (v4.0 - 2 MCPs):**
- ~1-2 seconds

**After (v5.0 - 6 MCPs):**
- Direct MCPs (memory, sequential-thinking): +0ms
- npx MCPs (playwright, context7, github, puppeteer): +2-3 seconds (first run only)
- **Total: ~3-5 seconds first run, ~1-2 seconds subsequent runs**

### Memory Usage

- memory: ~20MB
- sequential-thinking: ~15MB
- playwright: ~50MB (includes browser)
- context7: ~10MB
- github: ~15MB
- puppeteer: ~80MB (includes Chromium)
- **Total: ~190MB additional memory**

### Worth It?

✅ **YES** - Trade-off is acceptable:
- 3-5 seconds startup (one-time per session)
- 190MB memory (negligible on modern systems)
- Massive productivity gains from 6 specialized tools

---

## Migration from v4.0

## Security Considerations

### GitHub Token

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Store `GITHUB_TOKEN` in .env or system environment
- **NEVER commit .env to git**
- Use minimal permissions (repo only)
- Rotate token every 90 days
- Revoke token if compromised

### Puppeteer

**⚠️ CAUTION:**
- Can execute arbitrary JavaScript
- Can access any website
- Can download files
- Use with trusted sites only
- Set `ALLOW_DANGEROUS=false` unless needed

### Context7

**✅ SAFE:**
- Read-only documentation access
- No code execution
- No data collection (open-source)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Free MCPs
- memory: FREE
- playwright: FREE
- context7: FREE
- github: FREE (requires GitHub account)
- puppeteer: FREE

### Paid MCPs
- sequential-thinking: ~$0.10 per 32K token session
  - Average use: 2-3 times per week
  - Monthly cost: ~$1-3

**Total monthly cost:** ~$1-3 (sequential-thinking only)

---

## Future Improvements

### Planned

1. **Add official GitHub MCP** when `github/github-mcp-server` releases npm package
2. **SQLite MCP** for database operations (if community package matures)
3. **Git MCP** if official package releases (currently use Bash)

### Under Consideration

- **Time MCP** for timezone operations (low priority)
- **Browser automation alternatives** (Selenium Grid MCP if available)
- **Custom MCP servers** for Justice Companion-specific operations
