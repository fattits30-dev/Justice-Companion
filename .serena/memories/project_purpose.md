# Justice Companion - Project Purpose

Justice Companion is a **privacy-first AI-powered civil law case management PWA** for UK legal matters. The AI assists with administrative work and provides **legal information** (not legal advice).

## Critical Distinction: Information vs Advice

**Justice Companion provides LEGAL INFORMATION, not legal advice.**

| Legal Information (WE DO THIS) | Legal Advice (WE DON'T DO THIS) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "Here are some options to consider..." | "You should do this..." |
| "The time limit is typically 3 months" | "You must file by this date" |
| "Routes you might explore include..." | "The best approach is..." |
| "This is what the law says..." | "Based on your case, I recommend..." |
| "Consider consulting a solicitor about..." | "You don't need a lawyer for this" |

### AI Response Guidelines
- Present multiple options, not single recommendations
- Use phrases like "options to consider", "routes to explore", "you may want to look into"
- Always suggest professional legal advice for important decisions
- Explain what the law says, don't interpret it for specific situations
- Provide procedural information, not strategic advice

## Core Concept

**AI-Assisted Civil Law Administration** - The AI helps users organize and manage their case information, understand procedures, and explore their options - without telling them what to do.

## Key AI Capabilities

### 1. AI-Assisted Case Creation

- No assumptions made about case strategy

### 2. AI Case Management

### 4. Issue Identification (Not Fault Detection)
- AI highlights potential areas to review
- Flags possible gaps in documentation
- Notes timeline inconsistencies for user to consider
- Presents findings as "things to look into" not "problems"

### 5. RAG Knowledge Base
- Context-aware answers from user's documents and legal information
