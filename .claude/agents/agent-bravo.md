  # MISSION: Build useAI.ts React Hook

  ## OBJECTIVE
  Create production-ready React hook for AI chat with:
  1. Message history management
  2. Streaming token handling (real-time display)
  3. Loading states (connecting, thinking, streaming)
  4. Error states (offline, timeout, LM Studio not running)
  5. Auto-scroll to latest message

  ## TACTICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

  Every line of React code must be flawless. Users see every flicker.

  ### PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE
  - Review existing hooks (useCases.ts)
  - Check IPC API from preload.ts
  - Understand AI streaming: start → tokens → complete/error

  ### PHASE 1: STRATEGIC PLANNING
  Use sequential thinking to:
  - Design state shape (messages, loading, error, streaming)
  - Plan useEffect dependencies
  - Map IPC events to state updates
  - Handle cleanup on unmount

  ### PHASE 2: PHASED EXECUTION

  **Phase 1: Type Definitions**
  - ChatMessage interface (already exists, import from types/ai.ts)
  - Hook return type
  - State interfaces

  **Phase 2: Core Hook Structure**
  - useState for messages, loading, error, isStreaming
  - useCallback for sendMessage, sendStreamingMessage
  - useRef for accumulating streaming tokens

  **Phase 3: IPC Integration**
  - checkAIStatus() on mount
  - aiChat() for non-streaming
  - aiStreamStart() + event listeners for streaming
  - Cleanup event listeners on unmount

  **Phase 4: State Management**
  - Add user message immediately (optimistic update)
  - Show "thinking" state while waiting
  - Append tokens in real-time as they arrive
  - Handle completion (add full message to history)
  - Handle errors (show error, keep conversation intact)

  **Phase 5: Edge Cases**
  - LM Studio offline → show friendly error
  - Stream interrupted → partial message handling
  - Rapid successive sends → queue or disable
  - Empty messages → validate before sending

  ### PHASE 3: CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION
  After EACH phase:
  - Type check: npm run type-check
  - Verify no memory leaks (cleanup functions)
  - Test error paths (offline mode)
  - Check React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)

  ### NON-NEGOTIABLES
  - ALWAYS cleanup event listeners in useEffect
  - ALWAYS show loading states (no blank screens)
  - ALWAYS handle errors gracefully (user-friendly messages)
  - NEVER leave user wondering "is it working?"
  - NEVER block UI (all async operations)

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
  - useAI.ts compiles without errors
  - Hook follows React rules (ESLint passes)
  - Streaming tokens display in real-time
  - Errors show helpful messages ("Install LM Studio at...")
  - No memory leaks (listeners cleaned up)
  - Messages persist during session

  ## EXECUTION MANTRA
  User sees every flicker. Every loading state matters. Build smooth.

  BEGIN MISSION.
