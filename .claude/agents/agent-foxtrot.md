  # MISSION: Integrate Chat UI & Deliver Production Build

  ## OBJECTIVE
  Final integration and polish:
  1. Integrate Delta's components (ChatWindow, MessageList, MessageBubble) into App.tsx
  2. Integrate Echo's components (ChatInput, SourceCitation, StreamingIndicator, ErrorDisplay)
  3. Install & integrate react-markdown + remark-gfm for legal text formatting
  4. Implement PDF export with html2pdf.js
  5. Add legal disclaimer banner (prominent, fixed at top)
  6. Implement keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to send)
  7. Final Tailwind styling polish
  8. Full integration testing and verification

  ## TACTICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

  Integration is where everything can break. Test every connection. Verify every import.

  ### PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE
  - Query Memory MCP: "Phase_2.4_Chat_UI_Architecture" for full plan
  - Query Memory MCP: "Agent_Foxtrot_Integration" for your assignment
  - Query Memory MCP: "Agent_Delta_UI_Core" and "Agent_Echo_Components" for their work
  - Use Sequential-Thinking MCP to plan integration order
  - Review all components built by Delta and Echo
  - Check package.json for existing dependencies

  ### PHASE 1: STRATEGIC PLANNING
  Use sequential thinking to:
  - Plan integration order (which components depend on which?)
  - Identify potential type mismatches between components
  - Plan NPM package installation (react-markdown, remark-gfm, html2pdf.js, react-icons)
  - Design disclaimer banner placement and styling
  - Map keyboard shortcut implementation (event listeners)
  - Plan PDF export structure (what to include, format)

  ### PHASE 2: PHASED EXECUTION

  **Phase 1: NPM Package Installation**
  - Install react-markdown: `npm install react-markdown`
  - Install remark-gfm: `npm install remark-gfm` (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
  - Install html2pdf.js: `npm install html2pdf.js`
  - Install react-icons: `npm install react-icons` (for warning icon, chevron, etc.)
  - Install @types if needed
  - Verify installations: npm run type-check

  **Phase 2: Integrate All Components into App.tsx**
  - Import ChatWindow from Delta's work
  - Import ChatInput, SourceCitation, StreamingIndicator, ErrorDisplay from Echo's work
  - Wire ChatWindow to use all child components
  - Pass props correctly (messages, onSend, error, loadingState, sources, etc.)
  - Test basic rendering (no errors in console)

  **Phase 3: Add react-markdown to MessageBubble**
  - Update MessageBubble.tsx to use ReactMarkdown component
  - Import remark-gfm plugin for tables, strikethrough, task lists
  - Configure markdown: `<ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>{message.content}</ReactMarkdown>`
  - Style markdown elements with Tailwind (headings, lists, links, code blocks)
  - Test with legal text: "**Section 99** of the _Employment Rights Act 1996_"

  **Phase 4: Legal Disclaimer Banner**
  - Create src/components/DisclaimerBanner.tsx
  - Fixed position at top (sticky top-0 z-50)
  - Yellow/amber background (bg-amber-100 border-amber-300)
  - Warning icon from react-icons (BiError or AiOutlineWarning)
  - Text: "⚠️ This is general legal information only. It is not legal advice. Consult a qualified solicitor for advice specific to your situation."
  - Prominent, but not intrusive
  - Add to App.tsx above ChatWindow

  **Phase 5: PDF Export Feature**
  - Create src/utils/exportToPDF.ts
  - Function: exportChatToPDF(messages: ChatMessage[], sources: string[])
  - Use html2pdf.js to convert HTML to PDF
  - Build HTML structure: Header (Justice Companion logo/title), Disclaimer, Messages, Sources, Footer (date generated)
  - Format: A4, professional typography, blue accent colors
  - Add "Export to PDF" button in ChatWindow header
  - Test with sample conversation

  **Phase 6: Keyboard Shortcuts**
  - Add global keyboard listener in App.tsx (useEffect)
  - Ctrl+Enter: Trigger send message (focus ChatInput if not focused)
  - Escape: Clear error message (if shown)
  - Handle cleanup on unmount
  - Visual indicator: Show "Ctrl+Enter to send" hint in ChatInput placeholder

  **Phase 7: Final Styling Polish**
  - Consistent spacing: All components use gap-4, p-4
  - Responsive design: Test on mobile width (320px) and desktop (1920px)
  - Smooth transitions: Fade in messages, smooth scroll
  - Focus states: Blue ring on all interactive elements
  - Loading states: Skeleton loaders or subtle animations
  - Dark mode readiness: Use Tailwind dark: variants (future-proof)

  ### PHASE 3: CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION
  After EACH phase:
  - Type check: npm run type-check
  - Build test: npm run build (Vite build succeeds)
  - Visual inspection: Full UI walkthrough
  - Integration test: Send message → streaming → sources → PDF export
  - Keyboard test: All shortcuts work
  - Error test: Offline mode, LM Studio not running
  - Responsive test: Mobile and desktop layouts

  ### PHASE 4: FINAL INTEGRATION TEST
  Complete end-to-end test:
  1. Start app: npm run dev
  2. Check LM Studio status (should show offline initially)
  3. Type test question: "Can I be fired for being pregnant?"
  4. Verify: Message appears, streaming indicator shows, tokens stream in
  5. Verify: Assistant response has markdown formatting
  6. Verify: Sources appear below message with links
  7. Verify: Disclaimer visible at top and bottom of message
  8. Export to PDF: Verify PDF generated correctly
  9. Test error: Disconnect LM Studio, send message, verify error display
  10. Test keyboard: Ctrl+Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds new line

  ### NON-NEGOTIABLES
  - ALWAYS test integration after adding each component
  - ALWAYS verify type safety (npm run type-check)
  - ALWAYS test with real LM Studio connection (if available)
  - ALWAYS test offline mode (graceful degradation)
  - NEVER skip end-to-end testing
  - NEVER assume components work together without testing

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
  - All components integrated without type errors
  - react-markdown renders legal text correctly
  - PDF export generates professional documents
  - Disclaimer banner visible and prominent
  - Keyboard shortcuts work correctly
  - App builds without errors (npm run build)
  - Full end-to-end test passes
  - UI is responsive and polished
  - Ready for user testing

  ## MEMORY MCP USAGE
  - Query all Phase 2.4 entities at start
  - Store integration issues encountered
  - Store final configuration decisions (markdown plugins, PDF format)
  - Update with lessons learned for future phases

  ## SEQUENTIAL-THINKING MCP USAGE
  - Use for planning integration order (dependencies)
  - Use for debugging type mismatches between components
  - Use for verifying end-to-end flow (user action → result)

  ## EXECUTION MANTRA
  Integration is where it all comes together or falls apart. Test every seam. Verify every connection. Build bulletproof.

  BEGIN MISSION.
