  # MISSION: Build RAG Context Assembly

  ## OBJECTIVE
  Create the critical bridge: User Question → Legal APIs → AI Context → Information Response

  Components:
  1. RAGService.ts - orchestrates LegalAPIService + AIService
  2. Context builder - assembles LegalContext from API results
  3. System prompt enforcement - NEVER gives advice
  4. Source tracking - every claim must cite

  ## TACTICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

  Wrong context = wrong legal info = justice denied. Build precise.

  ### PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE
  - Review LegalAPIService.ts (from Agent Alpha)
  - Review AIService.ts (already exists)
  - Study system prompt template in types/ai.ts
  - Understand flow: Question → Keywords → APIs → Context → AI → Response

  ### PHASE 1: STRATEGIC PLANNING
  Use sequential thinking to:
  - Design RAGService class structure
  - Plan context assembly algorithm
  - Map API results to LegalContext type
  - Define relevance scoring for results

  ### PHASE 2: PHASED EXECUTION

  **Phase 1: RAGService Structure**
  - Create src/services/RAGService.ts
  - Import LegalAPIService, AIService
  - Define processQuestion() main method

  **Phase 2: Question Analysis**
  - Use LegalAPIService.extractKeywords()
  - Classify question type (employment/housing/consumer/civil)
  - Determine which APIs to query

  **Phase 3: API Orchestration**
  - Query legislation.gov.uk with keywords
  - Query Find Case Law with keywords
  - Fetch knowledge base entries (if exists)
  - Handle parallel API calls
  - Handle API failures gracefully

  **Phase 4: Context Assembly**
  - Build LegalContext object
  - Sort results by relevance
  - Limit to top 5 laws + top 3 cases (avoid context overflow)
  - Include source URLs for citation

  **Phase 5: AI Integration**
  - Pass LegalContext to AIService.chat()
  - Verify system prompt includes context
  - Extract sources from AI response
  - Return formatted response with citations

  **Phase 6: Safety Enforcement**
  - Verify response doesn't contain "you should" / "I recommend"
  - Ensure disclaimer present
  - Validate source citations exist
  - Log any policy violations

  ### PHASE 3: CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION
  After EACH phase:
  - Type check: npm run type-check
  - Test with sample question: "Can I be fired for being pregnant?"
  - Verify AI gets proper context
  - Check no advice language in responses
  - Ensure all sources cited

  ### NON-NEGOTIABLES
  - ALWAYS query both legislation + case law
  - ALWAYS limit context size (prevent token overflow)
  - ALWAYS track sources for citations
  - ALWAYS enforce "information not advice" rule
  - NEVER let AI respond without context
  - NEVER skip disclaimer

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
  - RAGService.ts compiles without errors
  - processQuestion() returns AI response with sources
  - Context includes relevant UK laws and cases
  - Response follows "information not advice" rule
  - All claims have source citations
  - Handles API failures gracefully (works with partial data)

  ## EXECUTION MANTRA
  Wrong context = wrong legal info = justice denied. Build precise.

  BEGIN MISSION.
