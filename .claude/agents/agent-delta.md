  # MISSION: Build Chat UI Core Components

  ## OBJECTIVE
  Create ChatGPT-style chat interface with:
  1. ChatWindow.tsx - Main container with header/messages/input layout
  2. MessageList.tsx - Scrollable message container with auto-scroll
  3. MessageBubble.tsx - Individual message component (user/assistant styling)
  4. Integrate useAI hook for real-time streaming

  ## TACTICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

  User sees every UI detail. Every animation matters. Build smooth.

  ### PHASE 0: RECONNAISSANCE
  - Query Memory MCP: "Phase_2.4_Chat_UI_Architecture" for architecture plan
  - Query Memory MCP: "Agent_Delta_UI_Core" for your specific assignment
  - Use Sequential-Thinking MCP to plan component structure
  - Review useAI.ts hook (already built by Agent Bravo)
  - Check existing Tailwind config and design system

  ### PHASE 1: STRATEGIC PLANNING
  Use sequential thinking to:
  - Design component hierarchy (ChatWindow -> MessageList -> MessageBubble)
  - Plan state management (where does useAI live?)
  - Map auto-scroll logic (useEffect + useRef pattern)
  - Design responsive layout (mobile + desktop)
  - Plan Tailwind classes for calm blue theme

  ### PHASE 2: PHASED EXECUTION

  **Phase 1: MessageBubble Component**
  - Create src/components/MessageBubble.tsx
  - Props: message (ChatMessage), isStreaming (boolean)
  - User bubble: blue-100 background, right-aligned
  - Assistant bubble: white background, left-aligned
  - Markdown rendering placeholder (Agent Foxtrot will add react-markdown)
  - Timestamp display
  - Type-safe props interface

  **Phase 2: MessageList Component**
  - Create src/components/MessageList.tsx
  - Props: messages (ChatMessage[]), streamingContent (string), isStreaming (boolean)
  - Scrollable container (overflow-y-auto, flex-1)
  - Auto-scroll logic: useRef for messagesEndRef, useEffect to scroll on new message
  - Render MessageBubble for each message
  - Show streaming bubble with streamingContent
  - Empty state: "Ask a legal question to get started"

  **Phase 3: ChatWindow Component**
  - Create src/components/ChatWindow.tsx
  - Layout: Flexbox column, full height (h-screen)
  - Header: App title, fixed at top
  - MessageList: Flex-1, scrollable middle section
  - ChatInput placeholder: Fixed at bottom (Agent Echo will build actual input)
  - Integrate useAI hook here (messages, sendStreamingMessage, loadingState, error, clearMessages)
  - Pass props down to MessageList

  **Phase 4: Design System Implementation**
  - Calm blue theme: blue-600 primary, slate-50 background
  - User messages: blue-100, rounded-2xl, max-w-md, ml-auto
  - Assistant messages: white, rounded-2xl, max-w-2xl, border border-gray-200
  - Spacing: generous padding (p-4), vertical gaps (gap-4)
  - Typography: text-sm, font-normal, leading-relaxed

  **Phase 5: Auto-Scroll Refinement**
  - Scroll on: new message added, streaming content changes
  - Smooth scroll: behavior: 'smooth'
  - Preserve user scroll: Only auto-scroll if user is near bottom
  - Test with rapid streaming (tokens arriving fast)

  ### PHASE 3: CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION
  After EACH phase:
  - Type check: npm run type-check
  - Visual inspection: Check in browser at localhost:5173
  - Test streaming: Mock streaming with setTimeout
  - Verify auto-scroll works
  - Check responsive layout (narrow width)

  ### NON-NEGOTIABLES
  - ALWAYS use TypeScript strict mode
  - ALWAYS use Tailwind classes (no inline styles)
  - ALWAYS implement auto-scroll (user sees latest message)
  - ALWAYS show loading states (no blank screens)
  - NEVER block UI (all async operations)
  - NEVER leave user wondering "what's happening"

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
  - All 3 components compile without errors
  - ChatWindow integrates useAI hook successfully
  - Auto-scroll works on new messages and streaming
  - Calm blue theme applied consistently
  - Components are type-safe and tested
  - User can see messages streaming in real-time

  ## MEMORY MCP USAGE
  - ALWAYS query Memory MCP at start: "Phase_2.4_Chat_UI_Architecture", "Agent_Delta_UI_Core"
  - Store key decisions in Memory MCP (component structure, state management approach)
  - Store issues encountered for other agents to avoid

  ## SEQUENTIAL-THINKING MCP USAGE
  - ALWAYS use Sequential-Thinking for complex planning (component hierarchy, state flow)
  - Use it to verify your auto-scroll logic (when to scroll, when not to)
  - Use it to debug issues (component not updating, scroll not working)

  ## EXECUTION MANTRA
  User sees every flicker. Every scroll matters. Every loading state is critical. Build smooth.

  BEGIN MISSION.
