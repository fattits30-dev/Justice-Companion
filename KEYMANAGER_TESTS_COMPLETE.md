# ✅ KeyManager Security Tests - Complete Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ALL TESTS PASSING (36/36 = 100%)
**Security Impact:** CVSS 9.1 vulnerability now fully tested

---

## Problem Addressed

**CRITICAL SECURITY GAP:** KeyManager.ts had ZERO test coverage despite being security-critical infrastructure handling OS-level encryption key storage (DPAPI/Keychain/libsecret).

This service fixes CVSS 9.1 vulnerability by replacing plaintext `.env` keys with OS-encrypted storage. Having no tests was a major security risk.

---

## Solution: Comprehensive Integration Testing

Created **36 comprehensive security tests** using integration testing approach:
- **Real filesystem operations** with temp directories
- **Mocked Electron safeStorage** (can't test real OS encryption in CI)
- **Automatic cleanup** of temp files in afterEach
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Unix permissions tests skip on Windows)

### Testing Approach

**✅ CORRECT (Integration Testing):**
```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as os from 'os';

beforeEach(() => {
  // Use real temp directory for integration testing
  testUserDataPath = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'keymanager-test-'));
  testKeyPath = path.join(testUserDataPath, '.encryption-key');

  // Mock only Electron safeStorage (can't test real OS implementation)
  mockSafeStorage = {
    isEncryptionAvailable: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(true),
    encryptString: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(ENCRYPTED_KEY),
    decryptString: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(TEST_KEY_BASE64),
  } as unknown as SafeStorage;

  keyManager = new KeyManager(mockSafeStorage, testUserDataPath);
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Clean up temp directory
  if (fs.existsSync(testUserDataPath)) {
    fs.rmSync(testUserDataPath, { recursive: true, force: true });
  }
  vi.clearAllMocks();
});
```

**❌ WRONG (Mocking Doesn't Work):**
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - Compiled KeyManager.js uses real fs, not mocks
vi.mock('fs', () => ({
  existsSync: vi.fn(),
  readFileSync: vi.fn(),
  // ...
}));
```

## Test Coverage by Method

### 1. getKey() - Load and Decrypt Key (6 tests)
- ✅ Load and decrypt key on first call
- ✅ Cache key after first load
- ✅ Throw error if safeStorage unavailable
- ✅ Throw error if key file does not exist
- ✅ Throw error if key is wrong length
- ✅ Clear invalid key from cache on error

### 2. hasKey() - Check Key Existence (2 tests)
- ✅ Return true if key file exists
- ✅ Return false if key file does not exist

### 3. migrateFromEnv() - Migrate from .env (5 tests)
- ✅ Migrate valid key from .env to safeStorage
- ✅ Throw error if safeStorage unavailable
- ✅ Throw error if key is invalid length
- ✅ Validate key is exactly 32 bytes
- ✅ Set file permissions to 0o600 (Unix only)

### 4. generateNewKey() - Generate Encryption Key (5 tests)
- ✅ Generate 32-byte key
- ✅ Encrypt and store generated key
- ✅ Cache generated key
- ✅ Throw error if safeStorage unavailable
- ✅ Generate cryptographically random keys

### 5. rotateKey() - Key Rotation (4 tests)
- ✅ Backup old key before rotation
- ✅ Generate new key after backup
- ✅ Handle missing old key gracefully
- ✅ Include timestamp in backup filename

### 6. clearCache() - Memory Security (3 tests)
- ✅ Clear cached key from memory
- ✅ Overwrite key buffer before clearing
- ✅ Handle clearing when no key is cached

### 7. validateKeyFile() - File Validation (4 tests)
- ✅ Return valid:true if file exists and is readable
- ✅ Return valid:false if file does not exist
- ✅ Return valid:false if file is not readable (Unix only)
- ✅ Check read permissions

### 8. Security Properties (4 tests)
- ✅ Never store key in plaintext on disk
- ✅ Use OS-level encryption for all key operations
- ✅ Enforce 32-byte key length consistently
- ✅ Protect key file with restrictive permissions

### 9. Integration Scenarios (3 tests)
- ✅ Handle complete migration workflow
- ✅ Handle key rotation workflow
- ✅ Handle key retrieval with caching

## Key Learnings

### 1. Don't Mock Filesystem for Compiled Code
Attempted to use `vi.mock('fs')` initially, but this doesn't work because:
- KeyManager is compiled to JavaScript
- The compiled code uses the real fs module
- Vitest mocks only affect module imports at test time

**Solution:** Use real temp directories with `fs.mkdtempSync()`

### 2. Buffer Mutation After clearCache()
`clearCache()` calls `buffer.fill(0)` to overwrite the key in memory for security. This mutates the buffer in-place.

**Problem:** Tests comparing `key1.toString('base64')` after clearing fail because `key1` is now all zeros.

**Solution:** Save the base64 string **before** calling `clearCache()`:
```typescript
const key1Base64 = key1.toString('base64'); // Save before clearing
keyManager.clearCache();
const key2 = keyManager.getKey();
expect(key1Base64).toBe(key2.toString('base64')); // ✅ Works
```

### 3. Cross-Platform File Permissions
File permission tests (`0o600`) only work on Unix-like systems. Windows doesn't support Unix permission bits.

**Solution:** Skip permission checks on Windows:
```typescript
if (process.platform !== 'win32') {
  const stats = fs.statSync(testKeyPath);
  const mode = stats.mode & 0o777;
  expect(mode).toBe(0o600);
}
```
